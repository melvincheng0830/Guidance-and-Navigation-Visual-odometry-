## About Visual Odometry

Visual odometry in robotics and computer vision is a process of analyzing camera images in order to determine the position of a robot. This technology is widely adapted in various fields of applications, including exploration rovers used in planatory explorations.

In unmanned aerial robotics, visual odometry can be utilized to achieve multiple purposes, such as surveying & mapping. Visual odometry can also be used to estimate the location of a UAV, recovering relative translation and rotation (Motion) by tracking image features over time using a calibrated camera model.
