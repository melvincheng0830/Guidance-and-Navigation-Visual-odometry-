## About Visual Odometry

Tutorial slide for Visual Odometry: <a href="Week 9 [Tutorial 2 Visual Odometry] Dr. Wen-V3.pdf"><strong>Link</strong></a>

Visual odometry in robotics and computer vision is a process of analyzing camera images in order to determine the position of a robot. This technology is widely adapted in various fields of applications, including exploration rovers used in planatory explorations.

In unmanned aerial robotics, visual odometry can be utilized to achieve multiple purposes, such as surveying & mapping. Visual odometry can also be used to estimate the location of a UAV, recovering relative translation and rotation (Motion) by tracking image features over time using a calibrated camera model.

## MATLAB and GitHub

MATLAB and GitHub can be used together to better achieve a collaborative coding and developing environment between developers or programmers. The setup of using MATLAB and Git would only take a few steps:

### 1. Install both MATLAB and Git in the local Machine

You can find the installation link for Git here: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"><strong>Link</strong></a>

MATLAB Official Website: <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html"><strong>Link</strong></a>

You will also need to have a GitHub account for this. You can create one in the GitHub webpage: <a href="https://github.com/"><strong>Link</strong></a>

### 2. Create a Repository / Join a repository where you have editing permission

You can create a repository by clicking on the "New" button on the left panel.

Alternatively, repository owners can invite collaborators to a repository in "Settings" --> "Collaborators".

### 3. Copy the repository link

You can copy the repository link at the front page of a repository by clicking the green "Code" button.

### 4. Link MATLAB and the GitHub repository

Open MATLAB and right click on the left empty space. You will see the option "Source Control". Click on it and paste the GitHub repository link that you just copied and click "Retrieve". Wait until the repository has been pulled to the local machine when you see the files appear on the left hand side.
